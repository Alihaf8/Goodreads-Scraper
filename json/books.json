For two thousand years, cadavers\u2014some willingly, some unwittingly\u2014have been involved in science\u2019s boldest strides and weirdest undertakings. They\u2019ve tested France\u2019s first guillotines, ridden the NASA Space Shuttle, been crucified in a Parisian laboratory to test the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, and helped solve the mystery of TWA Flight 800. For every new surgical procedure, from heart transplants to gender confirmation surgery, cadavers have helped make history in their quiet way. Stiff investigates the strange lives of our bodies postmortem and answers the question: What should we do after we die?"}
